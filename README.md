## API Documentation

LoanMe's API is the backbone of its functionality, offering endpoints such as:

- **`/page`**: Receives user data and returns a loan eligibility prediction.
- **`/results`**: Returns the results from the user's eligibility test.

The API is designed for ease of use, ensuring seamless integration with existing banking systems.

## Model Description

The heart of LoanMe lies in its machine learning model, built on a foundation of algorithms like Catboost and LightGBM. This model has been meticulously trained to analyze financial data and predict loan eligibility with high accuracy.

## Training and Evaluation

LoanMe's model underwent rigorous training and testing. We used a comprehensive dataset, focusing on features critical to loan approval decisions. Our evaluation metrics reveal a high level of precision and reliability, essential in the banking context.

## Usage

Using LoanMe is simple:

1. Access the web interface.
2. Input the required customer data.
3. Receive instant loan eligibility results.

## Future Work

We plan to enhance LoanMe by:

- Implementing additional machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.
- Introducing more robust data validation techniques.
